            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the most important component of a computer, often referred to as its brain. It is responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing data flow within the system. Every task a computer performs, from simple typing to complex gaming and software operations, is processed by the CPU.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Structure of the CPU</h2>
            <p>The CPU consists of three main parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Performs all mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).</li>
                        <li>Executes logical operations (comparisons like greater than, less than, equal to).</li>
                        <li>Helps in decision-making by processing conditions in a program.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Directs the operation of the computer.</li>
                        <li>Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.</li>
                        <li>Manages data transfer between memory, ALU, and input/output devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Registers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small storage locations inside the CPU.</li>
                        <li>Temporarily hold instructions, data, and addresses for quick processing.</li>
                        <li>Examples include the Accumulator, Program Counter, and Instruction Register.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working of the CPU (Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle)</h2>
            <p>The CPU follows a basic cycle to process data:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The Control Unit retrieves an instruction from the main memory (RAM).</li>
                <li><strong>Decode:</strong> The instruction is interpreted to determine what operation needs to be performed.</li>
                <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The CPU carries out the operation using the ALU or other components.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> The process continues for the next instruction.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This cycle runs millions or even billions of times per second, allowing computers to perform multiple tasks efficiently.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of CPUs</h2>
            <p>CPUs are classified based on their architecture, speed, and cores:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Single-Core Processor:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can handle one task at a time.</li>
                        <li>Slower compared to modern CPUs.</li>
                        <li>Example: Intel Pentium 4.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multi-Core Processor:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contains multiple cores (Dual-core, Quad-core, Octa-core).</li>
                        <li>Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Example: Intel Core i5 (Quad-core), AMD Ryzen 7 (Octa-core).</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) vs. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RISC: Uses a simplified set of instructions for faster processing (e.g., ARM processors in smartphones).</li>
                        <li>CISC: Uses a more complex instruction set, handling multiple tasks at once (e.g., Intel and AMD processors).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Clock Speed and Performance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clock Speed:</strong> Measured in Gigahertz (GHz), determines how many instructions a CPU can process per second.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> Small, high-speed memory inside the CPU that stores frequently used data for quick access.</li>
                <li><strong>Threads and Hyper-Threading:</strong> Some processors use Hyper-Threading (Intel) or Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) (AMD) to improve multitasking.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>CPU Cooling and Overheating Issues</h2>
            <p>CPUs generate heat while working, requiring cooling mechanisms like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heat sinks</strong> - Absorb and dissipate heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooling fans</strong> - Maintain airflow to reduce temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid cooling systems</strong> - Used in high-performance computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overheating can slow down performance and even damage components, so proper cooling is essential.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The CPU is the most crucial part of a computer, handling all data processing and instructions. Its speed, efficiency, and architecture determine a computerâ€™s overall performance. Whether in a mobile phone, laptop, or supercomputer, the CPU ensures smooth and reliable operation.</p>
