            <p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> is one of the most essential components of a computer. It acts as the <strong>central hub</strong> that connects and allows communication between all other hardware components, including the <strong>CPU, RAM, storage devices, input/output ports, and expansion cards</strong>. Without a motherboard, these components cannot work together efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Structure of the Motherboard</h2>
            <p>A motherboard consists of several key components, each serving a unique function:</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1. CPU Socket:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Used to connect HDDs, SSDs, and optical drives.</li>
                <li>NVMe slots provide high-speed SSD performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>7. Power Connectors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Supply power from the Power Supply Unit (PSU) to the motherboard and other components.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>8. Input/Output Ports:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>USB ports, audio jacks, Ethernet ports, and display connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA) are located on the motherboard’s rear panel.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Functions of the Motherboard</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Component Communication:</strong> Acts as a bridge that allows different components to exchange data efficiently.</li>
