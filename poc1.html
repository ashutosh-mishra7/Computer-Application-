            <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
            <p>The CPU, often called the "brain" of the computer, processes instructions and performs calculations. It consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for mathematical operations and the Control Unit (CU) for managing tasks. The speed of the CPU, measured in GHz, determines how fast a computer can execute commands. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Memory (RAM and ROM)</h2>
            <p>Memory is crucial for a computer's performance. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a temporary storage area where active programs and data are kept for quick access. It is volatile, meaning data is lost when the computer is turned off. ROM (Read-Only Memory) contains permanent instructions, such as the BIOS, which help the system start up. The more RAM a system has, the smoother it runs.</p>

            <h2>Storage Devices (HDD and SSD)</h2>
            <p>Storage devices store data permanently. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) use magnetic disks to store large amounts of data at an affordable cost. Solid-State Drives (SSDs), on the other hand, use flash memory, making them faster and more durable than HDDs. SSDs improve boot times and overall system performance, making them a preferred choice in modern computers.</p>
